Details
##Deliverables

    A Rails 4.2.4 utilizing
        react-rails
        a JSON API
        has-secure-password
        Seed data for conversations from 3 people in two rooms
    A link to a working Heroku instance

##Requirements
##Normal Mode

As you sign in, you'll be presented a list of rooms. Or, you can create a new room. Clicking on the room will present you with the latest 100 messages in that room.

You can post a message to the room and others will receive it in the order the messages are received within 3 seconds). Other people's messages will appear on your room's message list within 3 seconds as well.

Page loads should happen when I sign in, sign up, and choose a room, but other than that it should reload its own data.

As always, the design should be not-embarassing. Bootstrap, Materialize, Bourbon, or roll your own.

##Hard Mode

Everything in Normal Mode, plus:

    A user's post should render in Markdown, not just text
    Display the user's image (either gravatar or an uploaded profile image) next to their name
    If a user has a username "frank" and I say @frank what's up that should be bolded
    If a user posts a link to an image (ends in .gif, .jpg, .png) it should change that to a markdown image and display inline
    If I paste a link, it should be clickable in a new tab.

##Nightmare Mode

Everything in Hard Mode, plus:

    Instead of only showing the latest 100 messages, you should allow the user to click "Previous messages" and that will add the
    Add ability to search messages and display them
    Add ability to upload an image and have it display
    If someone posts a youtube link, change it to be an embed code and display the video.
